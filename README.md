# NLP-News
An in-school project where I analysed a dataset from a popular news network with NLP.

Thank you very much for checking on this smaller university project !

To run it: 
1)Simply download all the files and put then in a single folder on your desktop or where most convenient for you.

2)The dataset was two large to upload here, even if compressed. It was obtained from Kaggle. Download it from there and rename it to "data".
Here is the link for the dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adhamelkomy/news-classification-and-analysis-using-nlp

3)I used Spyder to write the code - on Anaconda 

4)It is a streamlit app project - to launch, use "streamlit run Intro.py".

5)It might take some time to load "NLP Analysis" and "NLP Visuals" pages - depends on the computational capabilities, or simply - how powerful your device is. Just wait, give it some time :)
